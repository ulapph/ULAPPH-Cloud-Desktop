We have taken every effort to design ULAPPH Cloud Desktop to be useful, informative, helpful, honest and fun.

All we ask is that you agree to abide by the following Terms and Conditions. Take a few minutes to look them over because by using our site you automatically agree to them. Naturally, if you don't agree, [please click here to tell us why and how you'd improve them](mailto:sayhello@opengovfoundation.org). We reserve the right to make any modifications that we deem necessary at any time. We will post such modifications on this page and, should the modifications be significant, advise by email ULAPPH Cloud Desktop users and those who have requested updates via this website. Your continued use of ULAPPH Cloud Desktop and other ULAPPH websites means that you accept those changes.

Thanks again for visiting and helping make governments and government information more open, accessible and participatory.

## Non-Profit Exemptions

ULAPPH is *not* for profit and is organized under section 501(c)3 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. That means we must comply with certain U.S. Government policies [helpfully explained here by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service](http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exemption-Requirements-Section-501(c)(3)-Organizations) and [here by Wikipedians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#501.28c.29.283.29). One policy is a prohibition on advocating for or against candidates for public office. We will make a good faith effort to ensure content on ULAPPH websites is compliant.

Please email questions, comments or concerns about ULAPPH compliance to [sayhello@opengovfoundation.org](sayhello@opengovfoundation.org).
